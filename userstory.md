As an *administrative user*, I want to create user accounts (at least via command line).

As a *user*, I want to modify my own log but not the logs of other users.

After a *user* has logged in, the users log should be shown (from the beginning of time).

As a *user*, I want to write my log entries in **markdown** format.

As a *user*, I want to use gol from my mobile as well as my desktop devices.

As a *developer*, I want to use my own storage backend.
